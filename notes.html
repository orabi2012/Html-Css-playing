    Lump-sum payments are also used to describe a bulk payment to acquire a group of items, such as a company paying one sum for the inventory of another business. Lottery winners will also typically have the option to take a lump-sum payout versus yearly payments.

    There are pros and cons to accepting lump-sum payments rather than an annuity. The right choice depends on the value of the lump sum versus the payments and one’s financial goals. Annuities provide a degree of financial security, but a retiree in poor health might derive greater benefit from a lump sum payment if they think they will not live long enough to receive the entire benefit. And by receiving an upfront payment, you can pass on the funds to your heirs.
    
    Also, depending on the amount, an upfront payment might enable you to buy a house, a yacht, or another large purchase that you would otherwise not be able to afford with annuities. Similarly, you can invest the money and potentially earn a higher rate of return than the effective rate of return associated with the annual payments. Or, of course, you could lose money on your initial investment.
